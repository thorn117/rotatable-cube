### A seamless rotatable cube in HTML, CSS and JavaScript

[Demo](https://codepen.io/thorn117/pen/WBPQbo)

The js code uses a change of basis algorithm to determine the transformation matices. Thus, the cube rotates always true to form and never rotates -270deg instead of +90deg.

Feel free to use this code wherever you see fit. A mention makes me happy.
